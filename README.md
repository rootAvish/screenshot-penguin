# Screenshot Penguin

Because all screenshot apps for Linux are bad. Like seriously, they all suck dunno y. Let's see if I can make a less shitty one.
If you have already beat me to this, please feel free to ping me(@rootavish) so that I can try your app and give you another star :smiley:. If you're in the process of making one and need another developer, again please feel free to E-mail me. I'll do anything it takes to help you out, because I'm frustrated with apps lacking the bare essentials.
